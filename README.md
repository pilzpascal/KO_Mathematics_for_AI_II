# Orthonormal Basis, Gram-Schmidt process
Here you can find all files belonging to the presentation on orthonormal basis for the course "**KO Mathematics for AI
II**" by Jan-Michael Holzinger at Johannes Kepler University Linz.

## What is this about?
This project deals with the topic of **vector spaces**, **basis**, **orthonormal basis** and the **Gram-Schmidt
process**, a process that takes as input a basis and returns another basis spanning the same space.

For more details please see the PDF file "presentation.pdf".

## Why are there two python files?
I chose to implement the Gram-Schmidt process for orthonormalizing vector basis twice, **once utilizing numpy** and
**once in pure python**. Why? Mainly as an exercises and out of curiosity. Implementing the corresponding methods such
as the inner product and the norm was fun and interesting.

I did not use OOP for the python implementation. It could be interesting to do so.
